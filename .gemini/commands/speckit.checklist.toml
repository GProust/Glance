## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

1. **Setup**: Run `.specify/scripts/pwsh/check-prerequisites.ps1 -Json` from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths must be absolute.

2. **Load design documents**: Read from FEATURE_DIR:
   - **Required**: spec.md
   - **Optional**: plan.md, data-model.md, research.md
   - Note: Not all projects have all documents. Generate checklist based on what's available.

3. **Determine checklist type**:
   - If the user provides a type (e.g., "UX", "security", "testing") in $ARGUMENTS, use that.
   - If no type is provided, default to a general "Quality" checklist.

4. **Execute checklist generation workflow**:
   - Load `.specify/templates/checklist-template.md` as structure.
   - Analyze spec.md and plan.md for specific requirements and technical decisions.
   - For UX: Focus on user flows, accessibility, responsiveness, and error states from spec.md.
   - For Security: Focus on authentication, authorization, data privacy, and OWASP best practices.
   - For Testing: Focus on edge cases, integration points, and success criteria from spec.md.
   - Generate relevant, actionable checklist items.
   - For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

5. **Generate checklist file**:
   - Save to `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/[type].md`.
   - Ensure it follows the markdown checklist format (`- [ ]`).

6. **Report**: Output path to the generated checklist and a brief summary of its contents.

## Guidelines

- Items should be objective and verifiable.
- Focus on "What" needs to be checked, not "How" to implement it.
- Keep the list concise and relevant to the specific feature.
